This project successfully extracted essential job posting data from a job site, providing valuable information such as job titles, company names, posting dates, locations, and categories for the benefit of job seekers, employers, and labor market analysts.

## Project Overview

This project involved the successful extraction of job posting data from a prominent job search website. The objective was to obtain critical information, including job titles, company names, posting dates, job locations, and job categories. This extracted data serves as a valuable resource for job seekers, employers, and labor market analysts.

## Scope

The project encompassed several key tasks:

- **Web Scraping Script**: A Python-based web scraping script was developed utilizing libraries such as BeautifulSoup. This script enabled automated access to the site to extract job posting details.

- **Data Extraction**: The script was designed to extract specific details from each job posting, which include:

- **Data Storage**: Extracted data was stored in a CSV file in a structured format, facilitating further analysis and utilization.

- **Data Quality Assurance**: Steps were taken to ensure the accuracy of the extracted data. Data cleaning and normalization were performed to enhance data quality.

- **Scalability**: The web scraping script was optimized for scalability, ensuring its efficiency in handling a large volume of job postings. Additionally, mechanisms were implemented to avoid website overloads and detection as a bot.

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation was created to provide clear instructions on how to use the scraping script, manage dependencies, and interpret the extracted data.

## Challenges

- **Adapting to Website Changes**: The script was designed to accommodate potential changes in the website's structure, allowing for quick adjustments if necessary.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Web scraping library (BeautifulSoup)
- Data storage (CSV)
- Proxy servers for web scraping

## Results
